# Pneumonia-Detection
To determine the presence of Pneumonia using Deep Neural Network models


This script aims to adopt state of the art deep learning models, specific image classification using convolution neural network (CNN) to predict the presence of pneumonia from X-ray images of patients lungs. 

I will be tuning the various hyperparameters of the model to dertermine the optimum layers and filters for the highest accuracy, while balancing the runtime required. 

The purpose of the research is to equip medical professionals with more accurate and reliable tool for pneumonia diagnosis, favouring the use of machine learning techniques over possible less reliable manual diagnosis by sight of doctors.
